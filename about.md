## Disclaimers
This site is a labor of love and we are building on it almost every day. If you see something strange, it's probably because Julia broke something and is working hard to fix it.
The Map, while visible, is currently under development and will continue to grow so keep checking back for cool new details :)

Please do the right thing and **do not** use our photos without contacting us first. We are very quick to respond to email so feel free to reach out at julia.b.sobczak@gmail.com
