Spending four months in the Bahamas definitely sounded better than continuing the monotony my girlfriend, Julia, and I faced with our day to day in Colorado. Don't get me wrong, we love it here, but a change of scenery can benefit everyone now and then.

We are still in the process of finalizing our entry and exit plans for the trip, but so far the pieces have been falling into place nicely. We began tossing around the idea of joining my parents, Jim and Denise, on their boat for their annual Bahamas trip while visiting them there in February of this year. At first it was just a funny "what if" scenario, but the more we thought about it the more we saw the potential for an unforgettable experience.

Our main concerns are our living situation leading into the trip and coming out of it. As for our possessions, we are selling anything nonessential as quickly as we can and have storage set up for the things we are keeping when we return. For now the focus is building our savings accounts and making sure all of our ducks are in a row come this November. Julia and I have lived in Denver since graduating college in 2019, but recently our disdain for the city has been growing. I can definitely say it didn't take much convincing for either of us to jump on board.

Our plan for the trip is to make our way from Colorado to Jacksonville, Florida a few days before Thanksgiving where we will stay with my family and enjoy the holiday. My parents have been compiling a list of things for their trip since last year and are adding to it frequently; this includes everything from food and beer to fishing supplies and toiletries. So we are planning on spending a few days post holiday to divide and conquer our list of essentials. Once we have the boat fully packed and fueled we plan to head south down the intracoastal waterway from Jacksonville to Miami and then make the jump from there to Bimini and the rest of the Bahamas.
